                    I love Indian food. All Indian food. However, when I ask people what their favorite Indian dish is, the answer more often than not is “Chicken Tikka Masala.” This has always bothered me a bit. Now, don’t get me wrong, Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING!
                    In fact, if I had to pick one Indian dish to introduce to a non convert, it would probably be Chicken Tikka Masala. But there is so much more to Indian food! Bhajji (or Pakoras) are crispy deep fried dollops of spicy chickpea batter
                    served with spicy condiments called chutney. Onion bhajji features thinly sliced onions that have been added to the chickpea batter and then deep fried to crispy perfection.

                    Another popular Indian street food is the samosa. Samosas contain a small amount of spicy potato or meat filling that are then wrapped in dough and deep fried until crispy and flaky. I love Indian food. All Indian food. However, when I ask people what

                    Vadas are deep fried dumplings or flattened patties of potato, and a pav is a plain old dinner roll. Vada pav is essentially a spicier vegetarian version of sliders where the dumpling or patty is sandwiched between two halves of a dinner roll. Oftentimes,
                    condiments are added to the mix (often a green mint and cilantro chutney). I love Indian food. All Indian food. However, when I ask people what their favorite Indian dish is, the answer more often than not is “Chicken Tikka Masala.”
